# Robz's LabWC Configuration

These dotfiles are a work in progress and are intended for educational purposes only.  
They are not meant for daily use.

Feel free to suggest tips or improvements.  
The goal of this configuration is to achieve a GNOME-like experience, but much lighter.

Here is a list of features I love in GNOME and would like to implement in my configuration:
- A top bar with intelligent hide (intellihide)
- Dock (using Dash to Dock)
- Control Center
- Rounded window corners
- Unified GTK theme for apps
- Wayland support (for improved laptop battery life)
- Beautiful media player widget
